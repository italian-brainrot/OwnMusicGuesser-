# Italian Brainrots Own Music Guesser!

How well do you know your music library? Guess which song is playing, with start time randomized!

### How to use
You should run OwnMusicGuesser.bat and also you should istall all libraries that it uses or it wont work. 

So you have to type in `pip install vlc ffmpeg` . 

You have to open your terminal and say that in it, so you should press windows start button and type in "terminal" and then say it to it. 

Also if it still doesn't work, then you should find "ffprobe.exe" like this one https://sourceforge.net/projects/dieiselripper/files/DieselRipper%20v%209.4/ffprobe.exe/download, but i used I different one. And put it next to "OwnMusicGuesser.bat".
